I'm working on a new monitoring system because I can't find one that solves
enough of my problems. It's going to be free and have an unrestricted open
source license.

I could use your help.

At this stage, the best way you can help is to make sure I get lots of data
about various infrastructure architectures, monitoring needs, reporting needs,
alerting needs.

If you can, please share with me the following:

  * A description (or diagram) of your infrastructure including network, servers, services, storage, etc.
  * What you are using now for monitoring (can be any number of tools)
    * Why you like them
    * Why you don't like them
    * What you'd rather have, if anything
  * What tools are missing that you wish existed?
  * Would more documentation on monitoring, in general, help?
  * Do you carry a pager? If not, why not? If so, what does it support? (email, sms, html email, mobile web, normal web)
  * Would more documentation help?
    * Better documentation on how to monitor the things you need to monitor?
    * Best practices for monitoring various scenarios?

Any thoughts, please email me jls-calmon@semicomplete.com - I'll be collecting this data into my design document, which you can view in unfinished form, here: [CalmonDesignDoc](CalmonDesignDoc.md)
